<em>Responsive, Intuitive Interfaces with Ruby</em>
The next step in the evolution of user interfaces is here.
Chatbots let your users interact with your service in their
own natural language. Use free and open source tools along
with Ruby to build creative, useful, and unexpected interactions
for users. Take advantage of the Lita frameworkâ€™s step-by-step
implementation strategy to simplify bot development and testing.
From novices to experts, chatbots are an area in which everyone
can participate. Exercise your creativity by creating chatbot
skills for communicating, information, and fun.
